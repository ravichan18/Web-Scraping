As part of this project, we will parse through the EODData website to get the details for Toronto Stock Exchange information.

We will retrieve information from the page ’Toronto Stock Exchange’ using web scraping: a process of extracting information from a website programmatically. For this specific project we will be scraping stocks starting with Alphabets A to H.
